# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive unit testing framework for the Auctane_Api Magento 2 module that can run independently without requiring a full Magento installation. The tests will be designed to run in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, providing automated testing for all core functionality including API endpoints, business logic, data models, and exception handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run unit tests locally without installing Magento, so that I can quickly validate my code changes during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `composer test` THEN the system SHALL execute all unit tests without requiring Magento installation
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL complete in under 2 minutes for the full test suite
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL provide clear output showing passed/failed tests with detailed error messages
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL return a non-zero exit code for CI/CD integration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want unit tests to run automatically in GitHub Actions, so that code quality is maintained through automated testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically trigger the test suite
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run tests and report results as PR status checks
3. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until tests pass
4. WHEN tests run in GitHub Actions THEN the system SHALL complete within 5 minutes including setup time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all business logic, so that I can confidently refactor and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for all Model classes
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test all Controller classes with mocked dependencies
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate all Exception classes throw correct HTTP status codes
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test all API request/response model serialization and validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mock Magento dependencies effectively, so that tests run independently without external system requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests initialize THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations for all Magento framework dependencies
2. WHEN testing controllers THEN the system SHALL mock HTTP request/response objects appropriately
3. WHEN testing models THEN the system SHALL mock database connections and repository patterns
4. WHEN testing API classes THEN the system SHALL mock external HTTP clients and responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test utilities and fixtures, so that I can easily create test data and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL provide factory methods for creating test data objects
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide sample request/response fixtures
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide helper methods for exception testing
4. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide mock authentication contexts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with code quality tools, so that code standards are maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL execute PHP CodeSniffer to validate coding standards
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL execute PHPStan for static analysis at level 6 or higher
3. WHEN code coverage is generated THEN the system SHALL produce reports in multiple formats (HTML, XML, text)
4. WHEN quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback for fixing issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run on multiple PHP versions, so that compatibility is ensured across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Actions run THEN the system SHALL test against PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4
2. WHEN testing multiple PHP versions THEN the system SHALL use a matrix strategy for parallel execution
3. WHEN any PHP version fails THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which version and why
4. WHEN all PHP versions pass THEN the system SHALL report successful compatibility across all tested versions
